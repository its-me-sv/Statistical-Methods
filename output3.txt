Let the straight line be y = ax + b

Weight of data,
	n = 8

The normal equations to fit a straight line y = ax + b,
by means of method of least squares is,
		a*Sigma(x) + n*b = Sigma(y)
		a*Sigma(x^2) + b*Sigma(x) = Sigma(xy)

Therefore, the normal equations are,
		a*Sigma(x) + 8*b = Sigma(y)
		a*Sigma(x^2) + b*Sigma(x) = Sigma(xy)

--------  --------  ----------  ---------

Therefore, the normal equations are,
		546.0*a + 8*b = 548.0 => (1)
		37314.0*a + 546.0*b = 37422.0 => (2)

Solving Equations (1) and (2) by Cramer's rule,
		D = [546.0, 8]
		    [37314.0, 546.0]
		Dx = [548.0, 8]
		     [37422.0, 546.0]
		Dy = [546.0, 548.0]
		     [37314.0, 37422.0]
		a = Det(Dx)/Det(D)
		  = -168.0/-396.0
		  = 0.42424242424242425
		b = Det(Dy)/Det(D)
		  = -15660.0/-396.0
		  = 39.54545454545455

Thus, the required equation,
	y = ax + b
	y = 0.42424242424242425x + (39.54545454545455)
